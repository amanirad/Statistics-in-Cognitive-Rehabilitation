# Statistics-in-Cognitive-Rehabilitation

The current repository for the final projects of the statistics course in cognitive rehabilitation (for MSc students in cognitive rehabilitation) in the
first semester of 2022-2023 at Shahid Beheshti University (SBU). Five projects are defined here that all students should complete all five projects with 
full details in the same Jupyter Notebook R file related to that project (codes and descriptions-interpretations of the codes, as well as conclusions, 
should be carefully added together in that file). Data for each project is uploaded here. 

The deadline for these projects is Saturday, February 15, 2023, (26 Bahman 1401) at 11:59 PM Tehran time and will not be extended in any way.

As soon as the projects are completed, please zip all five files of your project and send them to j.amanirad@gmail.com.
